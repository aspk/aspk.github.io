title: Duplicate question detection in question pairs!
---
In this post, we tackle the problem of classifying questions pairs based on whether they are duplicate or not duplicate. 

An example of two duplicate questions is 'How do I read and find my YouTube comments?' and 'How can I see all my Youtube comments?', and non duplicate questions is 'What's causing someone to be jealous?' and 'What can I do to avoid being jealous of someone?'
